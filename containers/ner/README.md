# Gretel NER Container Quick Start

This blueprint demonstrates how to launch the Gretel NER container with custom predictors. This assumes you have already
pulled the container image from DockerHub.

**NOTE**: You must set your `GRETEL_API_KEY` in `docker-compose.yml`

The following files are volume mounted into the container(s):

- `config.yml`: Defines all custom predictors that should be loaded for use by the API.

- `codewords.txt`: Is an example phrase list that can be used by the phrase predictor. Each phrase much be on a its own line.

To launch the container and test:

```
docker-compose up --scale ner=1
```

```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8000/ner/records/detect_entities \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"message": "Update: user_id12345678_BAL has completed working on operation ROCKYBALBOA as of 12/28/2020"}' | python -m json.tool
```

Resulting predictions:

```
